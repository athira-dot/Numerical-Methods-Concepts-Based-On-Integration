Many applications of calculus involve definite integrals.In most of the cases analytical evaluation of integrals is very difficult task.Hence we need numerical methods for defnite integral calculation.Trapizoidal rule,Simpson's rule and Gaussian Quadrature method are numerical integration techniques.

  The trapezoidal rule for estimating definite integrals uses trapezoids  to approximate the area under a curve.We partition the interval into an even number of subintervals, each of equal width. Over the first pair of subintervals we approximate area under the curve with quadratic function passing through the end points of that area.

  Simpson's Rule is based on the fact that given any three points,we can find the equation of a quadratic through those points. We are doing a comparative study of simpson vs trapizoidal rule.

  Gauss quadratures are numerical integration methods that employ Legendre points. Gauss quadrature cannot integrate a function given in a tabular form with equispaced intervals.
